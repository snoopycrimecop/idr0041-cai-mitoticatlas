Study Description	Using the cell and nuclear boundaries as landmarks, we generated a 4D image data-driven, canonical model of a human mitotic cell. This model is used to integrate the dynamic distribution of 3D concentration data for many mitotic proteins imaged by calibrated fluorescence microscopy in a large number of dividing cells. Analysis of the data allows to automatically identify sub-cellular structures and quantify the timing and magnitude of protein fluxes between structures, as well as predicting dynamic multi-molecular biological processes such as organelle assembly and disassembly. The integrated experimental and computational method enables building a 4D protein atlas of the dividing human cell.

Protocol Description	HeLa Kyoto cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM Glutamine and 1 mM (v/v) Sodium pyruvate at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Depending on the genetic modification, one or more of the following antibiotics were supplied to the culture at the stated final concentration: Geneticin 500 μg/ml, Hygromycin B 200 μg/ml or Puromycin 0.5 μg/ml. Once the cells reached 80-90% confluence, they were passaged and only a fraction of the cells were cultured in a fresh dish. All cells tested negative for mycoplasma contamination.	# text about any specific treatment to the cells here	Proteins of interests were expressed as GFP fusions from homozygously-edited genomic loci or in a few cases from a stably-integrated BAC. Confocal microscopy was performed on Zeiss LSM780, Confocor 3, laser scanning microscopes using 40x, NA 1.2 water DIC Plan-Apochromat objectives and the GaAsP detectors equipped with an incubation chamber. Time-lapse imaging was performed using the ZEN 2012 software combined with custom software. Mitotic cells were imaged live every 90 seconds for 60 minutes, taking 31 z-planes with a spatial resolution of 0.25 μm in x-y and 0.75 μm in z. At the end of acquisition, FCS measurements were performed at two positions in and four around the nucleus with a distance of 2 μm to the ellipse boundary for 30 seconds each.  	Each protein z-stack concentration map was processed using a bag-of-words model producing a vector of the fraction of the protein amount covered by each word.
