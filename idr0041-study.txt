Study Title	Experimental and computational framework for a dynamic protein atlas of human cell division
Study Type	protein localization
Study Type Term Source REF	EFO	
Study Type Term Accession	GO:0008104
Study Description	Using the cell and nuclear boundaries as landmarks, we generated a 4D image data-driven, canonical model of a human mitotic cell. This model is used to integrate the dynamic distribution of 3D concentration data for many mitotic proteins imaged by calibrated fluorescence microscopy in a large number of dividing cells. Analysis of the data allows to automatically identify sub-cellular structures and quantify the timing and magnitude of protein fluxes between structures, as well as predicting dynamic multi-molecular biological processes such as organelle assembly and disassembly. The integrated experimental and computational method enables building a 4D protein atlas of the dividing human cell.

Protocol Type	growth protocol	treatment protocol	image aquistion and feature extraction protocol	data analysis protocol
Protocol Type Term Source REF	EFO	EFO
Protocol Type Term Accession	EFO_0003789	EFO_0003969
Protocol Description	HeLa Kyoto cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM Glutamine and 1 mM (v/v) Sodium pyruvate at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Depending on the genetic modification, one or more of the following antibiotics were supplied to the culture at the stated final concentration: Geneticin 500 μg/ml, Hygromycin B 200 μg/ml or Puromycin 0.5 μg/ml. Once the cells reached 80-90% confluence, they were passaged and only a fraction of the cells were cultured in a fresh dish. All cells tested negative for mycoplasma contamination.	# text about any specific treatment to the cells here	Proteins of interests were expressed as GFP fusions from homozygously-edited genomic loci or in a few cases from a stably-integrated BAC. Confocal microscopy was performed on Zeiss LSM780, Confocor 3, laser scanning microscopes using 40x, NA 1.2 water DIC Plan-Apochromat objectives and the GaAsP detectors equipped with an incubation chamber. Time-lapse imaging was performed using the ZEN 2012 software combined with custom software. Mitotic cells were imaged live every 90 seconds for 60 minutes, taking 31 z-planes with a spatial resolution of 0.25 μm in x-y and 0.75 μm in z. At the end of acquisition, FCS measurements were performed at two positions in and four around the nucleus with a distance of 2 μm to the ellipse boundary for 30 seconds each.  	Each protein z-stack concentration map was processed using a bag-of-words model producing a vector of the fraction of the protein amount covered by each word.
